## Overview

A Next.js web app that fetches and aggregates live rankings/benchmarks across multiple sources (HTML + CSV), producing an overall metascore with clear source health status.

## Technical highlights

- Multi-source ingestion with retry/backoff and graceful degradation
- Firestore caching with scheduled refreshes
- Explicit aggregation rules (dense ranks, coverage filtering, missing-in-source penalty)
- Admin override panel for manual adjustments

## Hard parts

The hardest part was robustly parsing real-world web pages across sources without a headless browser, while still keeping the system resilient when individual sources fail or change structure.
