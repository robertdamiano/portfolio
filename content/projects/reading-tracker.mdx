## Overview

A family reading tracker built with Next.js and Firebase. It supports logging reading by minutes/pages/books, visualizes streaks and monthly progress, and includes milestone achievements.

## Technical highlights

- Firebase email/password auth gating the dashboard
- Firestore-backed activity feed, stats, and achievement tracking
- Monthly calendar heatmap view for consistency and progress
- Built-in CLI for importing Beanstack PDF reading summaries

## Hard parts

The biggest challenge was getting comfortable with Firebase’s local emulators, deployment workflow, and the “shape” of hosting + functions + Firestore in a real app.
